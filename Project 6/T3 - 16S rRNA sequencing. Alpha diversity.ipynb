    "Now, after we have processed all of the sequences and generated a feature table we are ready to study the samples’ diversity. Balanced gut microbiomes with greater diversity are present in healthy, long-living people, while disturbed microbiomes with dysbiosis (with increased levels of Proteobacteria or with reduced diversity) are observed in elderly people with different comorbidities [1] or are present in patients with diseases such as Crohn's disease, irritable bowel syndrome, obesity, autism, etc. Transplantation of fecal microbiota is aimed at restoring diversity [2]. Let’s see, if it is successful in our case."

    "First, the pipeline performs a multiple sequence alignment of the sequences in our FeatureData[Sequence] to create a FeatureData[AlignedSequence] QIIME 2 artifact. Next, it masks (or filters) the alignment to remove positions that are highly variable and only add noise to a resulting phylogenetic tree. After that, it generates phylogenetic trees – an unrooted tree and a rooted one, with the root  placed at the midpoint of the longest tip-to-tip distance in the unrooted tree."

    "Alpha diversity observes microbial diversity <b>WITHIN ONE</b> community (within-habitat diversity). The metrics here describe the richness or evenness of a microbial community, or a combination of both. Richness is the number of species present in the community. Evenness describes the distribution of the species count across the community. Evenness is highest when all species in the community have the same abundance and approaches zero as relative abundances vary."

    "In the picture above both communities contain five species, which means that richness is the same. There is a total of 25 organisms in each sample, so abundance is 25. The left community is dominated by one species. The right community has equal proportions of each species and therefore greater evenness. Thus the community on the right has higher species diversity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Such straight-forward estimation of richness and evenness is not always possible, as the number of species in a community is dependent on the number of collected samples. More species are usually collected with more samples, which invalidates the comparisons. A solution to this problem is to standardize the sampling by creating a taxon sampling (rarefaction) curve. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5BdGP4V5YA\">Rarefaction</a> is a resampling (without replacement) approach to generate a curve that allows comparisons among samples by selecting a minimum sample size of all the collections. Rarefaction curves are often used when calculating alpha diversity metrics to estimate the full sample richness. The rarefaction curve is plotted as the number of species against the number of samples. This is done by randomly re-sampling the sample pool multiple times and then plotting (usually) the quantity R of species in each sample. Usually, it initially grows rapidly, as the most common species are found, and then slightly flattens, as the rarest species remain to be sampled. If we obtain a similar quantity with fewer observations, R has converged on a good estimate of the correct richness. If R is keeps increasing or decreasing, then we cannot make a good estimate. In the example below, the red curve is still increasing - it has not converged. The blue curve has reached a horizontal asymptote - the value of R is a good estimate of the richness. In the case with the ever increasing species count, we have two possibilities: we need to collect more samples, because we have not yet sampled all the present species, or we have read errors that inflate R."

    "We need to apply the core-metrics-phylogenetic method to rarefy the FeatureTable[Frequency] to a certain depth. This also computes several alpha and beta diversity metrics. Here we need to provide an important parameter : --p-sampling-depth, which is the rarefaction depth. It determines most diversity metrics, randomly subsampling the counts from each sample to the provided value. If the total count for a sample is smaller than its value, those samples will be dropped from the diversity analysis. Choosing this value is tricky and important! Make the choice by reviewing the table.qzv file. Pick a value that is as high as possible so you retain more sequences per sample, while excluding as few samples as possible. Replace < add parameter > with an appropriate value. Which sample(s) did you exclude? Control, treatment or donor? To identify their label look at the metadata (remember, you downloaded it earlier)."
