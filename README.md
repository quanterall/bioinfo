# Bioinformatics course: Genomes, genes and gene expression

Welcome to the course! 

When you start working on a new project, check out the **Project tasks** first. 
Complete the notebooks in order and fill the **Project report**.

If you haven't worked with Jupyter Notebooks before and need an introduction, you can try it out <a href="https://docs.jupyter.org/en/latest/start/index.html">here</a>.

Have fun!
