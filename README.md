# Bioinformatics course: Genomes, genes and gene expression

Welcome to the course! 

When you start working on a new project, check out the **Project tasks** first. 
Complete the notebooks in order and fill the **Project report**.

If you haven't worked with Jupyter Notebooks before and you need an introduction, there's a useful guide <a href="https://www.dataquest.io/blog/jupyter-notebook-tutorial/">here</a>.

Have fun!
